# vbwd-fe-user-plugin-withdraw

> VBWD fe-user plugin: user-facing withdrawal / payout UI

**Type:** User frontend plugin · **Host app:** `vbwd-fe-user` · **Plugin:** `withdraw`

Part of the [VBWD platform](https://github.com/VBWD-platform). This repository is one
plugin in the modular VBWD SaaS marketplace platform; the core is intentionally
agnostic and gains this functionality only when the plugin is enabled.

## Install

Consumed by the **`vbwd-fe-user`** app as a plugin package. Register it in the app's
plugin manifests (`plugins.json` / `public/plugins.json` /
`var/plugins/*-plugins.json`) and enable it via the admin plugin settings.
Frontend plugins use **named exports** (`export const withdrawPlugin`).

## License

Business Source License 1.1 — see [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE). Free for commercial
